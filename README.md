# 🧠 Mood Tracker

A simple and user-friendly mood tracking app built with **Vite** and **React**.  
This project was developed in about a week as part of the **Fullstack Web & App Development Bootcamp** at **WBS Coding School**. I used this project to deepen my understanding of localStorage and to practice building user-friendly UI components using Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI.

- 🔔 **Feedback via react-toastify** to keep users informed

- 📆 **Switch between months** and view your **average mood per month**  
- 🔍 **Search function** for keywords in titles and content
